## 3 - Deployment

Before deploying, you first need to make sure the `homepage` key in your
`package.json` is pointing to the correct value. It should be the url of your
deployed application.

To deploy you should first make sure you are on the `master` branch with a
clean working directory, then you can run `npm run deploy` and wait to see if
it runs successfully.

## 4 - Usage

The Threadify front-end application is designed to offer a seamless and engaging experience for users. Here's how you can make the most of its features:

1. **Navigate through Threads**

Explore diverse discussions by navigating through threads created by users. Click on the comments button of each thread to delve into the conversations and discover a wealth of topics.

2. **Contribute to Discussions**

Engage actively by creating your own threads. Share your thoughts, experiences, or questions to initiate meaningful discussions within the community.

3. **Interact with Posts**

Like and comment on posts to express appreciation or contribute to ongoing conversations. The Threadify encourages interaction, fostering a vibrant and collaborative environment.

## 5 - Technologies Used

1. **React**

Leveraging the power of React, the application achieves a responsive and dynamic user interface. React's component-based architecture facilitates modular development and seamless updates.

2. **Axios**

Axios is used to make the HTTP client request for the below api end points.

- POST/sign-up - to sign-up new user.
- POST/sign-in - to sign-in user.
- DELETE/sign-out - to sign-out user.
- PATCH/change-password - to change password.
- POST/threads - to create a thread.
- GET/threads - to show all threads created by all the users.
- DELETE/threads/id - to delete the thread by the owner of the thread.
- PATCH/threads/id - to update the thread by the owner of the thread.
- GET/threads/ - to display the thread by the owner of the thread.
- POST/threads/id/comment - to create a comment to a specific thread by the authenticated user.
- POST/threads/id/like - to like the specific thread by the authenticated user.

3. **CSS**

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is utilized to style and design the application, ensuring a visually appealing and cohesive presentation. Custom styling enhances the user experience and aligns with modern design principles.

4. **BootStrap**

Bootstrap is used for responsive designed for buttons and forms and alert user messages.

5. **JavaScript**

JavaScript is employed for adding interactivity and functionality to the application. From handling user interactions to managing asynchronous requests, JavaScript enhances the overall responsiveness of the Threadify.

## 6 - Features

### `<AuthenticatedRoute />`

This template contains a handy component for creating routes that require a
user to be authenticated before visiting. This component lives in
`src/auth/components/AuthenticatedRoute.js` and is already required in `App`.
It's a thin wrapper around React Router's `<Route />` component. The only
difference is that it expects a prop called `user`, and if that prop is falsy,
it will render a `<Redirect />` that takes the user to `/`. **To use
it, you must pass it the user as a prop!**

It supports both the `component=` and `render=` attributes, but like `<Route />`
it will not forward props to the component if you use `component=`.

### `<AutoAlertDismiss />` Component

This template also already contains a component that displays user messages.
Messages are configurable via redux actions. This component can be found in
`src/components/AutoAlertDismiss/AutoAlertDismiss.js`. **There is no need to add
this component to your app. It is already required in `App`.** A single
component instance is used to manage all alerts application-wide.

The alert can be used by passing the `alertMsg` method to a rendered route. The
`alertMsg` method expects an object with a `heading`, `message`, and a `variant` property.

Use this component in conjunction with the `messages.js` file in the same
directory to create and manage all of your application messages in one place.

The `variant` property must be a Bootstrap alert variant, as this component is merely a
wrapper around the [react-bootstrap Alert
component](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/alerts/). The types it
will accept are: 'primary', 'secondary', 'success', 'danger', 'warning', 'info',
'light', and 'dark'.

To change the duration of the message, replace `5000` with a value of your
choice (in milliseconds) in this component's `componentDidMount` method.

### `src/apiConfig.js`

this file will determine whether you're in a production or development
environment and choose an API URL accordingly. Don't forget to replace the
`production` URL with your deployed API's URL.

## Structure

The top-level `App` component stores the currently authenticated
user in state, as well as data related to the flash messages. `App` renders the
`Header` component, and a list of routes, each of which render a component from
`src/components`. The `src/api` directory has a component file, `auth.js`, which
contains all the needed `axios` calls pertaining to authentication.

You can follow this pattern in your app as well. For instance, if you are making
an app that keeps track of books, you might want a `src/api/books.js`, which
contains its own `axios` call pertaining to your books resource CRUD actions.
Using a separate directory within `components` for each individual component you
add makes it easy to locate and update components and has the added benefit of
making it easy to create custom styles that apply to that specific component.
To apply component specific styles, add a file to the component's directory such
as `ComponentName.scss` and then import it directly into the component with
`import './ComponentName.scss'`. This will keep your styles modularized and
make it easier to make changes at the component level.

1. **Secure Account Creation and Authentication**

Users can securely create accounts using a unique username, email, and password. The Threadify employs robust authentication mechanisms to ensure the privacy and security of user information.

2. **Effortless Account Login and Logout**

Once registered, users can seamlessly log in to their accounts, providing a personalized and secure experience. The logout feature ensures a secure session termination, prioritizing user privacy.

3. **Thread Creation and Interaction**

Users are empowered to create threads, fostering a diverse range of discussions. They can actively engage with other users by liking and commenting on threads, contributing to a dynamic and collaborative forum environment.

4. **Personalized Thread Management**

The Threadify offers users the ability to create, comment on, and like threads. Each user can manage and interact with the threads they've created, enhancing a sense of ownership and contribution within the community.

5. **Thread Exploration and Interaction**

Users can explore and interact with threads created by others. The platform promotes a vibrant community atmosphere, encouraging users to read, like, and comment on threads contributed by their peers.

6. **Secure Sign-Out Functionality**

Users can securely sign out of their accounts to ensure the protection of their personal information. The sign-out feature guarantees a complete and secure session closure.

These features collectively provide users with a comprehensive and secure experience within the Threadify. From account creation to active participation in discussions, the platform prioritizes user privacy, engagement, and seamless interaction.

## 7 - Upcoming features
